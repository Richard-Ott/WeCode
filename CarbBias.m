% This script calculates the bias in measurements for minerals
% that are either more or less soluble than their host rock.
% The script calculates for different weathering fractions and soil
% thicknesses how the bias would affect this specific sample.
%
% Conversly to Riebe and Granger, 2014, the nuclide concentrations are not
% calculated with exponentials. Nuclide concentraions are calculated used
% CronusCalc (Marrero, 2016). 
% The script calculates the deviations for differnent soil thicknesses
% (masses) and weathering fractions.
